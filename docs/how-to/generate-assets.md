# How to generate static assets

On the command line run `yarn build` this will generate production ready assets in the `public` directory.

Once the assets are generated the CSS and JavaScript files should be copied into the [dwp-jsa-citizen-ui-static-assets](https://github.com/valtech-uk/dwp-jsa-citizen-ui-static-assets) repository, committed and tagged.
